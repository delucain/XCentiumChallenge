            I began my IT career in hardware support. I was always interested in programming, and I volunteered any down time I had with the engineering/programming departments 
            at my various employers as often as I could. When I started working in eDiscovery, processing electronic documents into court evidence. This job involved a 
            large amount of manual editing of large delimited meta-data files. I would use the programming skills I developed at previous jobs to automate as much of 
            this work as I could, improving the efficiency of myself and my coworkers.

            Eventually, I was confident enough in my abilities to apply for a full time development job. I was hired as a temporary contract web developer for the McCombs 
            School of Business. I quickly found a large number of improvements I could make to McCombs' Sitecore instance as well as their development processes and procedures. 
            My efforts in this area were rewarded with a permanent position, eventually resulting in a Lead Developer role, largely due to my training duties of all new hires 
            and student workers.

            I have been a Sitecore Certified Developer for nearly 4 years. I have received both the standard and advanced developer certifications for Sitecore version 6 
            through Sitecore Training. I hope to continue my training with the Sitecore 7 and 8 certifications. I also intend to learn more about administering Sitecore 
            environments by getting the Sitecore System Administrator certification.

        <h3>Additional Skills and Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I am the Director of Education at the <a href="https://atxhs.org">ATX Hackerspace</a>. I'm responsible for developing new curriculum, scheduling classes, 
            recruiting skilled teachers, budgeting materials and classroom expenses, and teaching several classes, including New Member Orientation, Welding, and CNC 
            Laser Cutting. I have years of experience welding and building complex machines and electronics using everything from professional blueprints, crude sketches, 
            or even just verbal descriptions as guides. I am also capable of creating professional blueprints and 3D models for both mechanical and electrical engineering 
            projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've translated these skills gained from my hobbies directly into my web development career. I see websites as just one more complex system that can be learned, 
            controlled, improved and eventually mastered. The ability to create a product instantly without materials on a screen makes it that much more intriguing.
