        <h3>Additional Skills and Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I am the Director of Education at the <a href="https://atxhs.org">ATX Hackerspace</a>. I'm responsible for developing new curriculum, scheduling classes, 
            recruiting skilled teachers, budgeting materials and classroom expenses, and teaching several classes, including New Member Orientation, Welding, and CNC 
            Laser Cutting. I have years of experience welding and building complex machines and electronics using everything from professional blueprints, crude sketches, 
            or even just verbal descriptions as guides. I am also capable of creating professional blueprints and 3D models for both mechanical and electrical engineering projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've translated these hobbies directly into my web development career. I see websites as just one more complex system that can be learned, controlled, improved 
            and eventually mastered. The ability to create a product instantly without materials on a screen makes it that much more intriguing.
